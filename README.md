### Creating a new tray notification

<p align="center">
To use, create an instance of <em>TrayNotification</em> and define its title, message and notification.
<br>
</p>

```java
        String title = "Congratulations sir";
        String message = "You've successfully created your first Tray Notification";
        Notification notification = Notifications.SUCCESS;
        
        TrayNotification tray = new TrayNotification();
        tray.setTitle(title);
        tray.setMessage(message);
        tray.setNotification(notification);
        tray.showAndWait();
```

<p align="center">
Alternatively you can initialize the tray notification with its non-default constructors.
</p>

```java
        TrayNotification tray = new TrayNotification(title, message, notification);
        tray.showAndWait();
```

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">
The default animation is a sliding animation.

When <em>shownAndWait()</em> is called, the tray notification will show and wait until it is either dismissed
with the close button or programmatically through your code.

### Using different animations and notifications

<p align="center">
You can also individually customize notifications and animations.
<br>
Using a notice notification with a fading animation, for example:
</p>

```java
        String title = "Download quota reached";
        String message = "Your download quota has been reached. Panic.";
        Notification notification = Notifications.NOTICE;
        
        tray.setTitle(title);
        tray.setMessage(message);
        tray.setNotification(notification);
        tray.setAnimation(Animations.FADE);
        tray.showAndWait();
```

### Creating a custom tray notification

<br>

<p align="center">
You're also able to set a custom image or rectangle fill. You can use <em>showAndDismiss</em>, which will show both the
show and dismiss animation. You're also able to control the delay before dismissal following the show animation.
This is useful for when you want a notification to appear for a certain amount of time before closing.
</p>

```java
        Image whatsAppImg = new Image("https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/iconsimple-logotypes/512/whatsapp-128.png");
        
        tray.setTitle("New WhatsApp Message");
        tray.setMessage("Github - I like your new notification release. Nice one.");
        tray.setRectangleFill(Paint.valueOf("#2A9A84"));
        tray.setAnimation(Animations.POPUP);
        tray.setImage(whatsAppImg);
        tray.showAndDismiss(Duration.seconds(2));
```
<br>

### Setting a new tray overload methods

<p align="center">
A shorthand to changing the design of a tray animation is to use the <em>setTray</em>'s overloaded methods.
</p>

```java

        tray.setTray("Title", "Message", Notifications.ERROR);
        tray.showAndWait();
        
        //OR
        tray.setTray("Title", "Message", whatsAppImg, Paint.valueOf("#2A9A84") , Animations.POPUP);
        tray.showAndDismiss(Duration.seconds(10));

```
